A Colbert number (https://oeis.org/A258074) is an integer with more than 1,000,000 digits that is prime and has contributed to the in-progress computational proof that 78557 is the smallest Sierpi≈Ñski number. 

[Colbert.py](Colbert.py) contains entries [k,n,s,x,y] for the 6 Colbert numbers. Because the numbers are huge, that file is 35MB in size. For Colbert prime *p=k\*2^n+1*, *s^2 % p == p-1* and *p == x^2 + y^2*.  
[After having computed *sqrt(-1) (mod p)* for biggest 9,383,761-digit Colbert number in 10:45:01h [with patched LLR software](https://github.com/Hermann-SW/9383761-digit-prime#fast-sqrt-1-mod-p-for-9383761-digit-prime-p-1-mod-4), the other numbers were processed as well. Sum of suqares was easy to determine in few seconds from *sqrtm1 = sqrt(-1) (mod p)* with PARI/GP "halfgcd(sqrtm1, p)"]

File extension is ".py" so that Python can import it, but it can be read from PARI/GP with "\r Colbert.py" as well.

Since "mpz_class(...)" is not part of Colbert.py, C++ needs to read line by line, remove trailing ",\\" or only "\\" and then pass that to "mpz_class(...)".  

Same validation takes different amount of code in the three languages:  
```
hermann@7600x:~/Colbert_numbers$ wc --lines validate.*
  64 validate.cc
   9 validate.gp
  19 validate.py
  92 total
hermann@7600x:~/Colbert_numbers$ 
```

Here is validation done in all three languages:
